Example:

1. View Options
Show Guides: Toggles the visibility of all guides on your canvas.
Show Rulers: Shows or hides the Krita rulers at the top and left edges.
Lock Guides: Prevents guides from being moved accidentally with the mouse.
Snap: Enables snapping, so your brush or selections "stick" to the guides.

2. Layout Management
You can save your current guide configuration for future use:
Save: Give your current layout a name to store it on your hard drive.
Load: Choose a previously saved layout from the dropdown menu and apply it to your current document.
Delete: Removes the selected layout from your saved list.

3. Units: Pixels vs. Percentage
This tool allows you to work with two different units:
Pixels (px): Ideal for technical drawings or web design where fixed sizes are required.
Percentage (%): Perfect for artistic compositions (like the Rule of Thirds). Percentage guides remain relative to the image size, even if you change the unit back and forth.

5. Custom Names and Direct Entry
In the table, you can see a list of all active guides:
Renaming: Double-click the name (e.g., "H-0") to give it a custom description (e.g., "Horizon").
Direct Entry: Double-click the position value to type in an exact coordinate. In percentage mode, you can use decimals (e.g., 33.33).

5. Update and Maintenance
Update (Refresh): Since Krita does not always notify plugins when a guide is moved manually with the mouse, use this button to synchronize the list with the canvas.
Clear All: Deletes all horizontal and vertical guides from the current document at once.
6. Image Split
This button opens Krita's built-in "Image Split" tool, allowing you to quickly divide your canvas into equal sections or prepare it for export.
